## Description

This backend I built features APIs for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for routing, a [MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/getting-started/), the [Mongoose ODM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) and [Moment JS](https://momentjs.com/) for modifying dates.
